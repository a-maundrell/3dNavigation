🧭 3D Navigation Menu

A visually engaging 3D navigation menu built with modern HTML and CSS techniques. This project showcases how creative transforms, perspective, and animations can be used to build immersive UI components without relying on JavaScript; empowering navigation with depth, motion, and responsive interaction.

This navigation pattern is often seen in cutting-edge web interfaces where visual feedback and motion help enhance usability and delight users.

✨ Features:
- 3D transform effects for navigation entrance and interaction
- CSS-powered animations and transitions
- Seamless toggle trigger
- Fully responsive layout
- Lightweight

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates:
- Mastery of CSS 3D transforms and visual layering
- Use of perspective and transform-style for depth
- Animation sequencing for smooth motion
- Building UI components with visual hierarchy in mind
- Creating immersive interaction, mostly without JavaScript

📌 Usage:
This 3D navigation component can be dropped into any site layout to replace or enhance standard menus. It adapts to screen size and provides a dynamic interaction point, especially for portfolios, product sites, or creative agency themes.

Example HTML snippet:

<nav class="navigation-3d">
  <div class="menu-toggle"></div>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>

- Add variants for light/dark themes
- Integrate into a SPA or framework component

💡 Inspiration:
This project draws from modern navigation patterns where motion and depth elevate functional UI elements into engaging experiences. It was implemented manually to explore CSS transform and animation capabilities at an advanced level.
